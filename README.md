# AdvancedGameDesign_4096

This was another project created in a week for a game design class. The theme was numbers, for which we got the number 4096. As such, we created an array of 4096 cubes that the player can carve out to find a shape embedded.

There's two shapes, and they rotate between the two between each game. If I had had more time to work on this project I would have added tools to excavate more blocks at a time or more comfortably (e.g. hold to mine), but time constraints were tight for this class.
